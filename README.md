Porter Neural Networks: Delivery Time Prediction Model

# Overview
This project aims to build a regression model for Porter, Indiaâ€™s largest intra-city logistics marketplace, to predict delivery times for orders. Accurate delivery time predictions enhance customer satisfaction, improve resource allocation, and optimize delivery routing. Leveraging machine learning and neural networks, this project focuses on analyzing a rich dataset of delivery records and deriving actionable insights.

# Objectives
- Develop a machine learning model to estimate delivery times based on features like order details, restaurant location, and delivery partner data.
- Provide actionable insights to improve operational efficiency and customer experience.

# Data Highlights
The dataset includes:

- Features such as market ID, store categories, order details, and partner availability.
- Over 197,000 records detailing delivery metrics and associated attributes.
- Preprocessing steps to clean and encode data, handle missing values, and scale inputs for model training.
